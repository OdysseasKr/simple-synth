# Simple Synth
A simple-to-use subtractive synthesizer written in Python.

It is acts as a simple interface that receives the synthesizer parameters
to generate sounds. It is based on [irmen/synthesizer](https://github.com/irmen/synthesizer/)
but also includes a very simple interface and some additional components.

It was originally written for the [NatCom-soundmatching](https://github.com/OdysseasKr/NatCom-soundmatching)
project that involves matching sounds with a synthesizer and genetic algorithms.

The architecture of the synthesizer so far is the following.
